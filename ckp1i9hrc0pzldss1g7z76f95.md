## Hello mate üëãüèΩ

I believe in the same and when I started learning the MERN stack,<br/>I built [Code Runner](https://runcode.ml)  to understand the concepts better. I would like to share what I learnt by building Code Runner through this series.

### What is Code Runner first of all? ü§î
[Code Runner](https://runcode.ml) is a simple web application with an integrated code editor, which can be used to execute programs in various languages. It is built using MERN stack, i.e. it uses  [React](https://reactjs.org)  in the front end;  [Node](https://nodejs.org) ,  [Express](https://expressjs.com)  and  [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)  in the backend.

To learn more about the MERN stack check  [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack)  by MongoDB themselves.

There are multiple other platforms which serve the same purpose. This project is solely made to have a personal touch of features and UI and also learn to build web applications.

#### Features of Code Runner:
1. Run code in several different languages all in one place.
2. Write code faster with auto complete suggestions.
3. Save your code on the cloud and access it with a simple link.
4. Share the code with others using the same generated link. 
5. Everything for free **without** any **ads** or **signup**.

### What's included in this series? ‚Åâ
- We will learn to build a decent looking front end application using React and [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) which includes routing and redirection.
- We will learn to build a simple CRUD API using Node and Express and interact with MongoDB.
- We will also learn to use multiple third party libraries like  [react-ace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ace) ,  [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid) and others.
- We will learn to deploy this application on the internet.

#### Prerequisites to follow this series:
- Working knowledge of using React and Node will suffice.

### When will the articles be released? ‚è≥
- The number of articles in this series is not planned for now.
- There will be one article every week on Sunday night (IST) explaining one important functionality or feature.
- The code for the entire project will be shared on a public GitHub repo. The link for the repo will be shared in the upcoming article.
- #### Subscribe to my newsletter to stay updated about the articles' release. üì¨
